This was done as part of my final year project at University of Birmingham. Developed using ReactJS and KonvaJS (a js canvas framework), this application would allow a user of my IoT attribute based access control system to create and edit their policies using a drag and drop interface. They can also simulate running a request for a user in their household to ensure their policy has the intended effect.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
